ANALYSIS REQUESTED: Commercial Analysis with Diastase Activity by Schade method

| Parameter        | Result | Unit    | Method                         |
|-----------------|--------|---------|--------------------------------|
| HMF              | 0,5    | mg/kg   | DIN 10751-3:2018-09            |
| Moisture content | 17.1   | %       | ASU L 40.00-2/2, mod           |
| pH               | 6.9    | pH      | PM DE01.042:2022-04            |
| Diastase         | 31,5   | DZ      | ASU L 40.00-1. mod.          |
| Free acid        | 7.3    | mmol/kg | DIN 10756, mod.              |

HMF: not detectable < limit of quantification 0.1 mg/kg
Diastase: not detected < limit of quantification 1 DZ
Free Acid: not detectable < limit of quantification 0.1 mmol/kg

The Diastase number (DZ or DN) corresponds in value to the volume of a 1% starch solution in mL, which is degraded by the enzymes of 1 g Honey in 1 hour at 40Â°C
Expanded measurement uncertainties: HMF: +/-5 %rel, Moisture: +/- 0.8 %rel, pH: +/-3.3 %rel, Diastase: +/-7.2 %rel, Free acid: +/-10 %rel

Interpretation:
The pH value is above the typically observed range for honey (according to relevant literature: Persano Oddo, Apidologie 35 (2004), 38-81 and Swiss food compendium (2004)).
Some varieties of honeys such as Jujube honey may have higher pH values than 6.5.
Council directive 2001/110/EC).
Regarding the other parameters the sample corresponds to the legal regulations (Article 1 in connection with Annex II.
