This document may only be reproduced in full. The results given herein apply to the submitted sample only.

Interpretation:
The sample contains mostly pollen from nectarless plants, hence, the number of nectariferious plants is so low so that the values are not representative However, since the organoleptic properties are also in concordance with "Ziziphus Honey" the sample maybe called "Ziziphus Honey". In addition, the product name may be supplemented with information concerning the regional origin "Middle East" (Council Directive 2001/110/EC dated 20/12/2001 in combination with literature).
