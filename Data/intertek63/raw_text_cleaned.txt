(a) : accredited method. (na) : not accredited method. (1) DIN 10760 (2) Inhouse procedure (3) DIN 10964

Interpretation:
According to the pollen-analysis the above-mentioned sample may be called "Honeydew Honey". It may not be called "Ziziphus Honey" due to the weak organoleptic properties. In addition, the product name may be supplemented with information concerning the regional origin "Middle East" (Council Directive 2001/110/EC dated 20/12/2001 in combination with literature). The sample contains mostly pollen from nectarless plants, hence, the number of nectariferious plants is so low so that the values are not representative.
