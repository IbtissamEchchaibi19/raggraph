| Conductivity | 2.03   | mS/cm  | PM DE01.042:2022-04 (a) |

Expanded measurement uncertainty: +/-5.5 %rel

(a) : accredited method. (na) : not accredited method.

Interpretation:

In the investigated sample, the above-mentioned electric conductivity was determined.

In case of honeys, electric conductivities of at least 0.8 mS/cm correspond to the legal requirement of honeydew honey and chestnut honey and blends of these honeys.

The following honey types as well as blends with these honey types may exhibit deviating electric conductivities: strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), bell heather (Erica), eucalyptus, lime (Tilia spp.), ling heather (Calluna vulgaris), manuka or jelly bush (leptospermum), tea tree (Melaleuca spp.).
